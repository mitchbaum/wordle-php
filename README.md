# wordle-php


A project for my computer science class that recreated the New York Times's Wordle game with a new UI and leaderboard. The app will generate a new five letter word each game and will not repeat words when they have been solved (user must be signed in).

HOW TO USE:

Log in using a unique username and password. Play the Wordle game like you're used to!
